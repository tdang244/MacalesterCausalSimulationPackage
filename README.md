# This is MacalesterCausalSimulationPackage

Hello everyone, this is Thu, Ben, and Zoe, and we're current students in STAT 451: Causal Inference at Macalester College during Spring 2023. 

For our final project, we decided to build a package that can be used in conjunction with the exercises in STAT 451 to help all of you practice and familiarize yourselves with the causal inference concepts. 

We really hope this package is useful for all of you and will be your confidant on this Causal Inference journey!
