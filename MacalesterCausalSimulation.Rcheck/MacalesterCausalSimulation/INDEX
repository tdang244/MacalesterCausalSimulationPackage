                        marginal/conditional (in)dependence of the
                        three key causal structures: chain, fork, and
                        collider
ipw_viz_bar             Creating bar charts to check if the IPW
                        weighting actually removed the relationship
                        between treatment and the intended variable

                        propensity score weighting

                        specification for propensity scoring (linear or

                        data trends, and the red smooth shows the
                        predictions from a logistic regression model
